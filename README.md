# Bingusboard

Bingusboard is a work-in-progress fork of the original Focalboard project. The goal of this fork is to keep the core experience lean and familiar to fans of Trello-style task boards while staying lightweight enough to run comfortably on Linux with the built-in SQLite storage backend.

At this stage only the essential web client and Go personal server paths are actively maintained. Other Focalboard features—particularly the enterprise integrations, alternative database layers, and desktop or mobile bundles—may or may not continue to function and could be removed over time.

If you need the legacy documentation or broader feature set from upstream, see `HISTORIC-README.md`. Otherwise expect rapid changes while Bingusboard evolves toward a simplified, self-hostable board for personal workflows.
