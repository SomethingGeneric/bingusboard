Security
========

Safety and data security is of the utmost priority for the Bingusboard community. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in our codebase, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Reporting security issues
-------------------------

**Please do not use GitHub issues for security-sensitive communication.**

Security issues in Bingusboard or any of the accompanying tooling should be reported using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting at [https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard/security](https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard/security). Researchers who responsibly report valid security issues will be publicly credited for their efforts (if they so choose).

For a more detailed description of the disclosure process and recognition for past contributors, monitor [https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard](https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard) where announcements will be posted.

Bingusboard security updates are announced through the GitHub release feed at [https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard/releases](https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/bingusboard/releases). Follow or watch the repository to receive notifications about new versions or advisories.
